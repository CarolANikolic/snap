Snap is a platform that helps companies to sync their team for remote work. This project is an intro page to test my abilities on HTML, CSS and JS, specifically on creating dropdown navigation menus.

## Technologies used :hammer_and_wrench:
- [HTML5](https://html.com)
- [CSS3](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com)

## Requirements :computer:

To work with the code, you will need, before you begin, to install in your machine Git. Also, it's a good idea to have a source-code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Main Learnings :nerd_face:-
> Art direction sources to change image according to screen sizes<br>  
> Reinforcing the use of arrow functions
